- Dominator analysis
	- top-down
	- Rule: BB + {intersect of DOM of all predecessors}
- Post-dominator analysis
	- bottom-up
	- Rule: BB + {intersect of PDOM of all successors}

- Average iteration count, def, formula
	- trip count: how many times does the loop iterate? (obtained via control flow profiling)
	- Averaget trip count = weight(header) / weight(preheader)

- trace lengthy -> possible pitfalls?
	- layers of threshold -> on-trace may be too small
	- on-trace/off-trace trade-off is heuristic-dependent
	
- Draw Superblock
	- goal: eliminate side entrances (we keep side exits)
	- step1: select trace
		- there is only ONE trace in examples
	- step2: tail duplication
		- Identify side entrace
		- replicate all BBs and redirect
		- adjust weights

- If-conversion pro-con
	- If-conversion: algorithm for generating predicated code
		- handle arbitrary complex graphs -> automatic & efficient!
	- Pros:
		- larger basic blocks
		- convert control dependencies to data dependencies
	- Cons:
		- resource usage: if-converted BBs consume resources REGARDLESS of whether they are executed or not -> longer execution cycle
		- dependent height: dependence height (aka schedule length with infinite resources) -> max(IC-BB1, IC-BB2) -> could grow! (bad!)
		- hazard presence: e.g. subroutine call, pointer store -> makes optimization difficult when if-conversionend

- data flow analysis
	- GEN/KILL/IN/OUT (for 4 kinds)
		- LIVENESS (1) VARIABLES (2) GEN=CONSUMED (3) BACKWARDS (4) UNION
			- GEN: set of external variables CONSUMED in the BB
			- KILL: set of external variables KILLED(=DEFINED) by the BB
			- IN: set of variables that are LIVE at the entry point of a BB
			- OUT: set of variables that are LIVE at the exit point of a BB (UNION of SUCCESSORS)
		- RDEF (1) OPERATIONS (2) GEN=DEFINED (3) FORWARDS (4) UNION
			- GEN: set of operations DEFINED in the BB
			- KILL: set of operations KILLED(=DEFINED) by the BB
			- IN: set of operations that REACH the entry point of a BB (UNION of PREDECESSORS)
			- OUT: set of operations that REACH the exit point of a BB
		- ADEF (1) OPERATIONS (2) GEN=DEFINED (3) FORWARDS (4) INTERSECT
			- GEN: set of operations DEFINED in the BB
			- KILL: set of opeartions KILLED(=DEFINED) by the BB
			- IN: set of operations that are AVAILABLE at the entry point of a BB (INTERSECT of PREDECESSORS)
			- OUT: set of operations that are AVAILABLE at the exit point of a BB
		- AEXPR (1) OPERATIONS (2) GEN=EXPRESSED (3) FORWARDS (4) INTERSECT
			- GEN: set of operations EXPRESSED in the BB
			- KILL:
			- IN
			- OUT
	- Union, intersect <- when?
		- UNION: Liveness, Reaching def
		- INTERSECT: Available defs, Available exprs

- explain what SSA is, pro-con
	- Static Single Assignment Form
		- We give a unique name to each assignment to a variable
		- this is possible because virtual registers are unlimited
	- Pro
		- no overlapping registers
		- Def-Use chains become obvious based on register names
	- Con
		- phi nodes can make the code harder to transform

- explain what LICM is
	- Loop Invariant Code Motion
		- Move operations whose source operands do not change within the loop to outside the loop
	- Caveats
		- Does the operation execute at every iteration?

- slack, def, formula
	- def: measure of scheduling freedom; larger slack means more mobility, 0 means critical
	- formula: Lstart - Estart for each node
